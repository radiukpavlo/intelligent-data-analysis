    "1. **Content-Based Recommendations:** Build systems that suggest stuff based on item details—like movie genres or product tags. You’ll check how good they are by seeing if the suggestions make sense.  \n",
    "2. **Collaborative Filtering:** Make systems that use what users like (ratings, plays, purchases) to suggest things. You’ll test them with numbers like RMSE, MAE, precision@k, and recall@k.  \n",
    "3. **Matrix Factorization:** Create systems that break down data into patterns (using stuff like SVD or ALS) to guess what users might like. Test them with RMSE, MAE, precision@k, recall@k, MAP, and NDCG@k.  \n",
    "4. **Ranking and Scoring Tricks:** Try out ways to rank suggestions—like mixing popularity with smart guesses. See how they stack up using precision@k, recall@k, MAP, and NDCG@k.  \n",

    "- Be able to rank and score suggestions in cool ways.  \n",
    "- Test how good your systems are with the right metrics.  \n",
